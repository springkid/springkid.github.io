Just trying to kickstart my movie list app [La lista Noc][lalistanoclink], and refresh my Ruby on Rails skills. I am now practicing with these awesome tutorial from Mackenzie Child, ["How to build a movie review app in Rails 4"][youtubelink]

So, if you want to check it out, you can just view it here in my github page.

Cheers,
Jose
